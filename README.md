## Overview

The **Task Manager** application is a web-based tool for managing personal tasks effectively. Built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, this application provides an intuitive user interface for users to create, edit, filter, and track tasks based on priority and completion status. It leverages **localStorage** to persist task data, ensuring user information is retained even after page refresh.

## Key Features

1. **Task Creation**: Users can easily add new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level (High, Medium, Low).

2. **Task Editing**: Users can modify existing tasks to update details like the title, description, due date, and priority.

3. **Task Deletion**: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

4. **Task Completion Toggle**: Tasks can be marked as 'Completed' or reverted to 'Pending' with a single click.

5. **Filtering Options**:
   - **Search Filter**: Allows users to search for tasks based on keywords in the title or description.
   - **Priority Filter**: Users can filter tasks based on priority (High, Medium, Low).
   - **Status Filter**: Users can filter tasks based on their status (Completed, Pending).
   - **Date-based Filters**: Users can view all tasks, upcoming tasks (due in the future), overdue tasks, and completed tasks.

6. **Persistent Data Storage**: The app stores tasks in the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

7. **Edit Task Modal**: A modal interface for editing tasks provides a seamless user experience without navigating away from the main page.

8. **Responsive Design**: The UI is built with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a responsive and clean design across different screen sizes.
